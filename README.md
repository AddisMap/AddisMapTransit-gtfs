The open license for this data is currently not decided yet.

The data was collected on the ground and uploaded to OSM by AddisMap Team. This data is validated on OSM and directly extracted from the OSM OverPass API. 
Please use any GTFS validation tool of your preference to do GTFS Specific validation. Note that you need to check the OSM history and routes data status before extracting new GTFS data set as such changes on OSM would affect the GTFS data too.
